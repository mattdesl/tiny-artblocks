# tiny-artblocks

A starter kit for tiny and robust [ArtBlocks](https://artblocks.io/) artworks with plain vanilla JavaScript.

<img src="./docs/image.png" width="50%" />

These tools were used to develop and deploy [Subscapes](https://github.com/mattdesl/subscapes) (which was 17kb after compression).

Features:

- A framework similar to [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch)
- Live reload on code changes
- Strong minification/compression
- Prints minified bytes and approximate ETH deploy cost on each reload
- A robust pseudo-random number generator and hashing function (for `tokenData` seed)
  - The included PRNG is suggested by [@piterpasma](https://twitter.com/piterpasma), and uses an "xorshift128" generator.
- Some utilities for color, math, random, and vector to get you started
- Additional function analysis, listing the byte size of the largest functions after minification
- Reports syntax errors in the browser
- A set of [Tips](./docs/tips.md) for further minification

## Install

Git clone this repo, move into it, and install its dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mattdesl/tiny-artblocks.git

cd tiny-artblocks

npm install
```

Now you can run the scripts below.

## Usage

Run one of the following scripts in the same terminal:

#### `npm run start`

Runs a development server on [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081), where changing code in `src/` (or `www/index.html`) will automatically rebuild to `www/main.min.js` and then reload the page.

Hit `Ctrl + C` to quit the development server.

#### `npm run build`

Produces a final production build to `www/main.min.js`, giving byte and ETH cost stats.

#### `npm run inspect`

Inspects the minified source code and lists the byte length of named functions, ordered by size. This is helpful to find the largest offending functions in your bundle.

It does not inspect certain closures and arrow functions.

## Source Structure

See `./src/` folder:

- `index.js` is the main entry point which sets up a canvas
- `sketch.js` is the main canvas-sketch style sketch function, which accepts a hash and returns a `render(context, width, height)` function
- `util/` is a folder that contains some example utilities (PRNG, color, math)

## Prototyping with npm and Node modules

You can also `npm install [some-module]` and then `import { foo } from 'some-module'` in your bundle, but I would only recommend doing this for prototyping. You can then copy the code manually into `util` and restructure it with ES6 and other optimizations for smaller results.

## Code Golf Tips

See [./docs/tips.md](./docs/tips.md) for a series of suggestions on how to reduce bundle size.
